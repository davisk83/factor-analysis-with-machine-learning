# Factor Analysis with Machine Learning
Author: Davis Kurniawan, Ivanna Maxwell

## Project Description - include target audience, objective, methods
The main idea of this machine learning project is to develop and train various algorithms that fit
stocks characteristics and the corresponding performance. We will mainly focus on performing
technical analysis rather than fundamental analysis, which means that we will deep dive into
economic and financial factors that drive the overall performance of a stock. Our target
audience will be mainly for other groups of students who are interested in machine learning
applications in the investment industry. However, other groups such as asset management firms
and scholars are also included in our target audience. We will implement at least 2 sets of
algorithms and evaluate the different performances of each algorithm.

## Sample Data
There are several data resources available that can be leveraged for this project:
- [Machine Learning Factor Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17wm7QOqy90s7Jy-v1ZEO-iOkZn4mdXP7/view) (1)

This data set comprises US stocks information that ranges from November 1998 to
March 2019. Additionally, for each stock, this data set also includes 93 characteristics
that cover topics ranging from valuation, momentum, volatility, and other attributes.
- [Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Equity Technical Analysis Data](https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/NDWEQTA/data) (2)

This data set originated from Nasdaq and can be obtained via the API. It contains over
50 technical analysis data points, covering more than 25.000 global equity stocks.
